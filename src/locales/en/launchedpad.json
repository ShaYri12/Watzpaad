    "question-four": "What is the difference between guaranteed allocation and lottery levels?",
    "answer-four": "Lottery levels — CHANCE, PROSPECT, AFFILIATE — only give you a chance to win in a lottery for each IDO. Once the registration period ends, you will be able to see if you're a winner on a pool page. Guaranteed levels guarantee you the allocation calculated based on the base allocation and your level multiplier."
